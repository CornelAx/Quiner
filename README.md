# Quiner
A light-speed bot to complete the Queens Puzzle on Linkedin

It uses threading so be careful not to fry your pc
It does not need any information about your linkedin account because it doesn't log in to submit the time (you can do that manually)

Please install the dependencies from requirements.txt

The 100mapQuiner.py may or may not crash (it crashes randomly). If it does, just restart it until it stops crashing lol
